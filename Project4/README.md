READ ME FOR PROJECT 4: GAME OF SET. 

Use set.html.

This game involving matching and selecting three cards with the same or all different amount of shapes, colors, infills and numbers.
There are twelve cards on the screen all the time. The deck will have 69 cards remaining in the begining.
The game defaults into single player mode.
The game is playable in single player mode and it will count the overall score of the player.
The game can also be played in multiplayer local versus mode.
After clicking the start a versus game button, the web page will go into versus mode. It will first reset/restart all the current deck,
  table,scores etc, then the users are prompt to input how many players there will be.
And all the users need to input their user name as a tracker.
After input is complete, the game will start.
Select the card you want to choose usign mouse clicks. The selected cards will be highlighted.
If you want to unselect cards, select it twice.
Upon selecting a set, the game will check if it is a set or not.
If in multiplyer mode, the game will ask for the current player's username before displaying the result and modifing the score.
User get one point if they get it right. User lose one point if they get it wrong.
User score cannot go below zero. This means the user can guess as many time as they want if their score is zero. (New player friendly)
Once the deck is empty and the user found a set, the game ends. And scores will be displayed.
After user closing the window, a new game will be started and the user can start again.
The maximum possible point avaiable for a player is 24 points.
If you want to restart the game, simply refresh the page.

"No set?" button:
It is possible for the table to not have a valid set displayed. In this case, user can press the "No set?" botton.
If there is no set on the table, three random cards will be replaced and the user will be rewarded a point.
If there is a set on the table, the user got penalized a point for mistakenly click the button and the available set will be highlighted.
After user correctly selecting the highlighted set, the user will be rewarded one point back.
So the user will not lose point for pressing the hint button if the user behave correctly.
(But the hinted cards got discarded thus reducing the maximum possible points)
while in versus mode, if No set? button is pressed, the game will ask for who pressed the button first to modify the correct user's score.
(it is possible to input another user's name for No set? and using the hint to help you increase the score.
This is unethical but legal for the following resons:
 It is possible while someone else is pressing the No set? button you found out a set.
 Thus the game allows any user to choose another set other than the hinted set. (or the hinted set) after pressing the No set? button.)

"Click here to start a versus game" button:
As discribed, this is a button starting a versus game. The core mechanics of a versus game is described above.
But there is few things to note:
1.Because a user's score cannot decrease below zero. Thus for any player that have zero point,
    it is possible for them to just click random sets and test their luck or press No set? button to get a free hint(or point).
    Please refrain yourself from doing that since in multiplayer mode it can disrupt other players.
2.The total points avaiable is 24 points but it is very possible that the players didn't get some of the sets thus don't be upset when
    you see some one have more than 10 point and you have zero.
3.The person founding the set is advised to shout "set!" (or "no set") in real life to avoid collision with other players
    while playign the game. The first person did so have the privilage of testing their sets and got rewarded (or punished)
4.After a game ends, the webpage will reset while preserving current player information so that players don't need to input their
    informations again. (If you want to change your user name, simply start another versus game using the button to setup another game)
5.Because clicking the start a versus game button will clear current player/score information. Thus remember not to start a game if you
    want to save your progress in single player. Just open another instance of the webpage and leave the previous one in the background.
6.If you want to start another single player game while in multiplayer mode, simply refresh the webpage.

"SUPER SECRET STEALTH CHEAT!! BUTTON" button
Just Cheat Cheaters ^_*
Nah, it is more for testing the program is working intendedly finding the sets and no set situations.
While it also function as a legit cheat button since it will increase the user score both in single player and multiplayer mode.
Note: Surprisingly, there is actually zero effort in making it hidden nor secret nor stealth in anyway. It is just a visible button.
