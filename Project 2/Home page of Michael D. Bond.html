P.S. If you're on the waitlist for a section of 3341:

If you're interested in getting enrolled, please attend class while you're on the waitlist! During the first week of class, the enrollment system will automatically enroll waitlisted students as spots become available. During the second week of class, as spaces become available in each section, I'll help students get enrolled based on the same order used by the enrollment system (per CSE department policy): (1) priority for CSE/CIS/DA majors and (2) waitlist order.

Please understand that, in an effort to be fair to everyone, I won't help anyone get into the class out of priority+waitlist order, and I won't start adding anyone before the second week of class. When you're eligible to be added, I'll let you know by contacting you via Piazza and in class. So you don't need to do anything other than attend class and check e-mail/Piazza. :)
